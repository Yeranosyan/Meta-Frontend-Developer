## Little-Lemon Restaurant Project created by Gagik Yeranosyan 2023
In my front-end development journey, I mastered HTML and CSS for building strong foundations. JavaScript empowered me to create dynamic user experiences. With React, I excelled in crafting modular and efficient UI components. Git ensured smooth collaboration and version control. Understanding UX/UI principles enhanced my design approach.
